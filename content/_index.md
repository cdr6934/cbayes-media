Currently as an indivdual, this dream iis a little out there and perhaps crazy. 

Yet... 

Eventually I see a multidisciplinary team combining the expertise of software engineering, 
research, engineering and data-driven design to deliver custom solutions that inspire and engage. 

I've been working on a few different projects: 
* **[Varanorr](https://varanorr.com/)** - Research / Design Studio 
* **[Haus Mono](https://hausmono.com/)** -  a printing operations workflow for artists
* **[Pixel Poetry](https://pixelpoetry.xyz)** - AI Strategy services


This is also a bit of my personal site for the time being but I hope that it becomes a vision on its own.
