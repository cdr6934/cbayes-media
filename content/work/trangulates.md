What I just love about this is the graininess added to create certain images to be more blurry. This can be made with shaders, but there is something beautiful when using simply "pixels" to paint certain elements of the image. Computationally more expensive? 

Yes. But it does have to beg the question, does efficiency always inquire something beyond the work that has been done here.
