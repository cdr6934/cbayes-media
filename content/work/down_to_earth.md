# Down To Earth (2023)

I am writing this on 3/3/2023 at around 1:20 PM while the great winds and potential tornados in Middle Tennessee. It just seemed right to put it out there given the circumstances.

"Down On Earth and To The Heavens" is a generative reflective collection as a depiction of the feelings I have when I think on the subject of living and longevity.

The longer we live, the more I just realize that the bustle of life is but noise. Noise that causes grief, anxiety, and the other drama that comes with it. Yet when we get a 10,000 ft view, we realize we are in the hands of nature.

There are a few elements that have been added in here that in mind really make me think of these great forces of nature.
