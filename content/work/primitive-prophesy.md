# Primitive Prophesy 

These were originally added to the Tezos network in 2021 as my first curated long-form project. They can be found on [Objkt](https://objkt.com/asset/hicetnunc/228810)

What I am about to write here is something that will bring some information about the project. 

The set of images are part of the exploration of the primitive elements, sticks and earth tones. I wanted to explore how simplicity can bring both chaos and order to the same generative agent that is creating these images. You can find more on Twitter @generatecoll or Instagram @generate.collective (2021)
