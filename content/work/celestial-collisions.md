This collection, found at fxhash, is an artistic exploration marrying the gentle fluidity of organic textures with the whimsical randomness of color pencil simulations. Each piece in the series is a testament to the unpredictable beauty of celestial phenomena, crafted through a sophisticated algorithm that offers over 380,000 unique combinations, ensuring that every orientation of the artwork remains distinct and engaging.

Drawing inspiration from a childhood filled with starlit imaginations and celestial wonder, I recall moments spent capturing the night sky through my mother's cherished Minolta. Those early years, punctuated by visits to the planetarium, nurtured a fascination with the stars â€” not just as distant balls of gas, but as symbols capturing the human spirit's boundless curiosity. This fascination extends to the stars' periodicity, echoing a cosmic order and continuity amidst the apparent chaos of the universe, an element subtly woven into each artwork's design.

## Specific for the NFTs
Experience the artwork interactively:

* Atom Dynamics: Activate the 'atoms' to witness a pulsating dance, where these elemental particles fluctuate from near invisibility to a commanding presence, depending on the interval settings. This feature requires careful observation to appreciate the varying degrees of visibility among the atoms.

**Controls**:
's' to save a snapshot of the current state
'a' to activate or deactivate the atom feature
Designed to be fluid in its presentation, the piece naturally adapts to different resolutions, with its default being a crisp 1000x1000. This adaptability is not just a technical feature but an artistic choice, encouraging viewers to experiment with various sizes, each offering a unique window into this cosmic dance of colors and shapes.
