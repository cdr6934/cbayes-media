This has been an interest of mine for a while. I've started on this but there is yet much to be done and a continuation of a process that I'd like to refine in the next year or so. 

I used [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org/) and found that it was quite easy to make some of these images. I didn't realize how easy this was going to be and I have been daunted by the task of 3D modelling. However I've been taking alot of time to mess with Blender and Houdini to really get a sense on what they can do. This has allowed me to really understnad the terminology that is used in these programs and thus I've been able to really put that knowledge to work.
