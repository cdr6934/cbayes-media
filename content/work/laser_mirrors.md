The following project is inspired by exploring what lasers and long exposure photography. 

## Start 

I used openSCAD to first create a few functions that will give me the raw materials that I needed to start with a flexible "pegboard" that can be used to distribute mirrors in a specific manner. 

I bought some adhesive mirrors off of [Amazon](https://amzn.to/48ck3lH) for $10 as a start. I then created the paddles on which I adhered the mirrors and then created an OpenSCAD function that would provide me the board in which I placed the mirrors. With that created, I started with a basic array of mirrors to see what can be done with them.
