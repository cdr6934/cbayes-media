 There is something majestic about the land. The utter vastness and then also the  isolated sense that the expansive is just even bigger than oneself. Its bigger than my current issues or problems. It delivers a sense of awe that just cannot be attained everywhere. 

 Much of that is  due to the  vastness of the land. Think desert, like Joshua Tree but with more varying hues of earth tones.
