This was originally written up [here](https://rstudio-pubs-static.s3.amazonaws.com/306404_eb693e8fadc140eb9f199394f39d3849.html#).. here is the original repo on my [Github](https://github.com/cdr6934/ImageManipulationExperiments/tree/master) 

I always thought this experiment was incredibly interesting. It was using something that I hadn't even thought about this until I was an app on the phone before the Apple Watch. 

So I wanted to see if I could pull out the images, analyze the information so that I could determine the peaks in the Red color channel and pull out some of the information that could be used.
