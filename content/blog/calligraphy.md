The following work has been a bit of a reflection and getting away from the screen for a little bit. When working on a masters, working a full time job and then enjoying program. There becomes a point I need to get away from the work and take some time to do something more craftsmanlike. 

Calligraphy has been a practice of mine for many of years. You will find that there are a number of different forms that are built into each of the images. I'll update with better images but for right now these are the ones that I have.
