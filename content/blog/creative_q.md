I've been collecting various quotes for many years. One of my favorite genres has been quotes about creativity. In this project I had scraped Good Reads and looked for quotes that had anything to do with art and creativity. Stored them in a Postgres table. Created an API using [ValTown](www.val.town) from where I am using it to pass through when calling against the postgres instance. Right now it simply is a little tool to ponder on quotes. 

I also use this dataset from which I pull out the quotes I use on the newsletter as well.
